    <p>You have spent your life protecting someone else’s. Perhaps it was a noble, or a powerful crime boss; maybe even a brutal warlord. Maybe instead of someone more powerful than you, it was a physically weaker companion or family member. Whatever the case, your life up to this point has been focused around protecting someone.</p>

    <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
    <p>Body guards are generally good at protecting; whether they’re protective by nature or simply good at their job is up to you. Their skill at guarding and noticing dangers, as well as their relationship to their charges, affect how they act and think. Their flaws could be being overly protective or hesitant, or maybe something that somehow compromises their guarding abilities.</p>

      <p>I have a keen eye when it comes to safety. My companions and I can travel at a normal speed through crowds; and I can always pick out the safest route to take through a town or city. This doesn’t account for unseen or hidden dangers, such as a lair of vampires hiding in the noble quarter; but I can easily avoid slums and areas where thugs might hang around.</p>
